# Project 1: Shell[ing] out commands
by William Lin and Sharon Zou

## Features:
1. Reads and parses a command by semicolon
2. Forks and execs the command
3. Parent process forks waits for the child to finish
2. Exit and cd commands
3. Executes commands regardless of spaces before and after commands (but can only have one space between words in a command)
3. Reads and separates multiple commands on one line with ;.   
4. Simple redirection using > (redirecting stdout) and < (redirecting stdin) (no >> or <<)
5. Implements simple pipes

## Attempted Implementation
These were the problems we had in our shell after continuous tries:
1. Multiple redirection in one command doesn't work (Commented out, could not get this to work)
2. Running commands with more than one space within a command

## Bugs
1. Could not get certain errors to display without the error continuously popping up throughout the program (we commented out the code for errors instead)
2. Multiple redirection < > does not work and breaks the program
3. Typing in something like "hello > one.txt" will cause the program to wait for input instead of printing an error
4. Running too many times may result in a segmentation fault due to memory overload
5. Not sure if pipe works for more complicated commands

## Files and Functions
<b> fork.c </b>

`void initialize();`
- inputs: nothing
- returns: nothing
- prints a message to let the user know that he/she has entered the shell

`char ** parse_args(char *line);`
- inputs: `char *line`
- returns: a pointer to a array of different parts of one command
- Parses the array by white space

`void execute(char **args);`
- input: `char ** args`
- returns: nothing
- forks and executes commands

`char ** reading();`
- Input: None
- returns: the command line and parses by semicolon if necessary

`char ** parse_semi(char *line);`
- inputs: `char *line`
- returns: a pointer to an array of different commands separated my semicolons
- Similar to parse_args, but this function is specifically for moments when there are semicolons within the command

`int redirectout(char **input, int pos);`
- inputs: `char **input`, `int pos`
- returns: nothing
- redirects the command from input

`int redirectin(char **input, int pos);`
- inputs: `char **input`, `int pos`
- returns: nothing
- redirects the command from input

`void piping(char **input, int pos);`
- inputs: `char **input`, `int pos`
- returns: nothing
- Implements simple pipes

<b> main.c </b>
- Runs the code; decides whether or not the command uses redirect or pipe

<b> funcheaders.h </b>
- Contains the function headers
