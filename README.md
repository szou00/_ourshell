Project 1: Shell[ing] out commands

by William Lin and Sharon Zou

Features:
      - Reads a command
      - Parses multiple commands by semicolon
      - Forks and executes commands
      - Can execute commands regardless of spaces before and after commands (but can only have one space between words in a command)
      - Exit and cd commands
      - Simple redirection using > (redirecting stdout) and < (redirecting stdin)

Attempted:
      - The following did not end up working, but have been left in the code, commented out.
      - Attempted to run commands even with more than one space within a command
      - Continuing the shell after redirection
      - Debugging the implementation for pipes

Bugs:
      - Running too many times may result in a segmentation fault due to memory overload
      - Not sure if pipe works

      - char ** parse_args(char *line);
          - inputs: char *line
          - returns: a pointer to a array of different parts of one command

      - char ** reading();
          - inputs: command line
          - returns: the command line and parses by semicolon if necessary

      - void execute(char **args);
